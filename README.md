# MEMORIZE! 
## Project for Ironhack module 1. By Lucas Martins 
### Made with :heart:, JS, HTML5 and CSS3

# The idea
Memorize is a spatial memory game designed to improve motor skills and memory. Inspired by people with alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease. The idea is that these people can exercise the brain in a fun and casual way. This is just a project in the initial phase, any person who is interested, please contact me.
